    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "    I first imported the data and isolated Black Mountain Resort. After this step I did a train/test split to train the model on different subsets of data. After this step, I trained a regressor to guess the mean, and it did calculate the provided mean (from the y subset) of the data. I then created a function to calculate the r-squared value and noted that the initial model created from the mean value had no determination for the data. I used the r-squared value to train the prediction, and trained a new regressor to predict values, which it did with slightly lower consistency. I created a function to calculate the average of the absolute errors in the y subset training data, as well as the mean squared. I then used this to train the y subset. There is still a slight difference between the training predictor and the test (mean-based) predictor. I used sklearn metrics and learned that the order of arguments has a huge impact on the outcome. I then created test sets based on the median values on the x-subset of the data. I the made a linear regression model to train the data (x and y) on this split. In the split test, the trained model accounts for the variance of approximately eighty-two percent of the data, whereas the test subset only predicts the variance for approximately seventy-two percent of the data. The model predicts data that is much closer to the real price compared with the mean, which is probably skewed by the upper tail of the distribution. This leads us to choose the median to substitute into the missing values for the data. I then filled the missing values in both train and test sets, and scaled the data. Finally, I trained the model on the split between x and y, trained and scaled tests. \n",
    "\tI then went onto creating a pipeline. Initially I fit the data to determine missing values using the x and y subsets which I trained. I then made predictors based on the trained and test x subsets, now referred to as y subsets in the pipeline. I compared the previous model to the pipeline and the results are the same. I then refined the pipeline to make predictions based on the variables that are best predictors of the data. However, using a subset of ten is worse than using all features, so it is necessary to find the best number of features to use. There are issues here because we are using features based on the test set without knowing how it might perform based on alternate data. I then assessed the performance by cross validating with the earlier x and y trained models, this gives us an estimate of uncertainty for the pipeline. I learned how to use the ‘get_params()’ method for pipelines to select the best quantity of features, k, to use to create the pipeline, which is approximately eight. I used ‘coefs’ to select the top eight coefficients which have most predictive power for ticket prices. \n",
    "\tIn the next stage, I used a random forest model. I defined the random forest pipeline, rf-pipe, to use the median based on data collected above. I then cross-validated the rf-pipe against the x and y trained models from earlier. I refined the new pipeline by using parameters and a k-value from earlier, which gave me a ‘best estimator.’ I made a bar plot showing how important each variable is to predictions. From here I selected a final model, between the linear regressor and random forest regression, the random forest regressor had a lower mean absolute error. I plotted the diminishing marginal returns of increasing test size for cross-validation scores.\n",
